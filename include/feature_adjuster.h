/** \brief an adaptively adjusting detector that iteratively detects until the desired number
 * of features are detected.
 *  Beware that this is not thread safe - as the adjustment of parameters breaks the const
 *  of the detection routine...
 *  /TODO Make this const correct and thread safe
 *
 *  sample usage:
 //will create a detector that attempts to find 100 - 110 FAST Keypoints, and will at most run
 //FAST feature detection 10 times until that number of keypoints are found
 Ptr<FeatureDetector> detector(new DynamicAdaptedFeatureDetector(new FastAdjuster(20,true),100, 110, 10));

 In contrast to the original DynamicAdaptedFeatureDetector, this variant is enhanced for
 processing of video sequences. It is meant to work with the DetectorAdjuster.
 It keeps the DetectorAdjuster alive, so that the final threshold will be retained
 throughout detection calls. For video sequences the "good" threshold will in
 general be similar for successive frames, therefore the last "good" threshold
 is a good starting point for the next frame.

 In case of too many features, this variant will just decrease the threshold of the
 DetectorAdjuster without triggering redetection, so the user needs to get rid of the
 superfluous keypoints. Mostly the keypoints are scored anyway, so this avoids
 costly and unnecessary redetections.
